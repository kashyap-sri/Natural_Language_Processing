# Natural_Language_Processing

Dataset:
This project makes use of a corpus that consists of thousands of text messages which is classified as either ham or spam.
It can be used to get a hang of NLP and very good to play around with using nltk.

Description:
The project is develpoed to showcase different techniques of Natural Language Processing.
Steps:
1. Preprocessing of data using nltk.
2. Vectorizing texts using scikit-learn.
3. Fitting the processed data into a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to make a prediction.

Note that there are two different models. One without splitting the data into training and testing sets and one after splitting them.
Both of them perform well. Splitting your data into testing and training is highly recommended!! (Golden Rule of Machine Learning)

Cheers!
